                    A framework for building cross-device applications using plain JavaScript or Polymer.
                    An integration with the React framework is currently under construction. Handles connection management,
                    data synchronisation, and provides information about roles and devices.
                    Includes a library for device-to-device communication that uses peer-to-peer channels (WebRTC) if supported and falls back
                    to a client-server architecture with WebSockets if not.
                    Provides default layouts for commonly used patterns. The demo section of this website has been built with XD-MVC. Several
                    sample applications are available including a maps and a gallery application.

            <h3>XD-Testing</h3>
            <p>A system for the automatic testing of cross-device applications. Allows tests that take into account multiple devices and runs them
            for multiple designed or randomly generated device configurations.
            This project is still at an early stage. It will be published on Github later on.</p>

                <p>
                    A set of tools for testing and debugging web-based cross-device applications. Allows the emulation of multiple devices at the same time,
                    coordinated record and replay across multiple devices and the integration of real devices. Device configurations can be switched easily
                    (for example tablet-tablet to tablet-phone-desktop) and existing debugging tools such as the console have been integrated.
